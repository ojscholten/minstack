# minstack
Ethereum DApp template using a minimal stack.


## Goal
This repo aims to create a fully functional single-page web application which interfaces with the Ethereum blockchain using as little code as possible.

To make this happen, I can take a few shortcuts as follows;
 - load the web3 library injected by [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html) instead of holding copy
 - use CDN's to load jquery and bootstrap (purely for styling)

## Deployment Guide
To get this project up and running on your own system, 

 - xamppp - metamask combo
 - remix for solidity dev
 - contract deployment??
